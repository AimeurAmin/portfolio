# Portfolio
This project was created to showcase my experience in react developement, full usage of functional based components along-side with some of the most popular hooks (useState, useEffect for now), plans to include more hooks all along with redux are made and yet to come. Animations implemented in this project are derived from the stunning framer-motion library.
